# SolarIntel - Solar Energy Generation Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning system that forecasts hourly solar energy output across 29 European countries. The pipeline fuses 15 years of solar capacity factor data from the European Commission's EMHIRES dataset with hourly meteorological observations from NASA's POWER API, trains two regression models, and serves predictions through an interactive web application.

### Walkthrough/
Complete documented walkthrough of the project. Contains the Jupyter notebook (`walkthrough.ipynb`), a formatted PDF version (`walkthrough.pdf`), and the original EMHIRES methodology paper. This is the recommended starting point for anyone looking to understand the pipeline, the data science decisions behind it, and the results.

### Pipeline_Modules/
A modular breakdown of the pipeline into individual scripts. Each subfolder contains a standalone Python file for one stage:

| Module | Stage |
|--------|-------|
| Dataset Visualisation | Raw data exploration and plotting |
| Cleaning and Transformation | Data integrity checks, reshaping, feature extraction |
| Merging | Fusing EMHIRES generation data with NASA weather data |
| Encoding | One-Hot Encoding of country labels |
| Training and Evaluation (LR) | Linear Regression model training and metrics |
| Training and Evaluation (RFR) | Random Forest Regressor training and metrics |
| Analysis Visualisation (LR) | Diagnostic plots for Linear Regression |
| Analysis Visualisation (RFR) | Diagnostic plots for Random Forest |

### Final_Pipeline/
Contains `Final_Pipeline.py` - a single consolidated script that runs the entire pipeline end-to-end in one execution, from data loading through to model export.

### NASA_Data_Fetch/
Contains `fetcher.py`, the script used to collect hourly weather data (Irradiance, Temperature, Wind Speed) from the NASA POWER API for all 29 countries from 2001 to 2015. The fetch takes approximately 20+ minutes due to API volume. The resulting CSV is already provided in the Datasets folder.

### Datasets/
Compressed raw and processed datasets:
- `solar_data.zip` - EMHIRES solar capacity factor CSV and NASA weather master CSV
- `merged_encoded.zip` - Fully merged, cleaned, and encoded dataset ready for training

### Models/
Contains `solar_models.zip` with the two trained model files (`solar_model_lr.pkl` and `solar_model_rfr.pkl`). Load directly with `joblib` for inference without retraining.

### Demo_and_Hosting/
The Streamlit web application deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. Provides real-time predictions, 24-hour generation profiles, feature importance analysis, seasonal patterns, and model performance metrics.

### Report/
Contains the formal project report in both LaTeX source (`Report.tex`) and compiled PDF (`Report.pdf`). Covers data sources, pipeline architecture, feature engineering, model training, evaluation results, deployment, and future work.
